# P4 Scripts
Scripts to help automate various Perforce tasks

## P4 Config Setup

Batch file used to quickly and easily generate a [p4config](https://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/cmdref/P4CONFIG.html) file for non-technical folk.

## P4 Re-typmap

Python script used to apply a [typemap](https://www.perforce.com/perforce/r14.2/manuals/cmdref/p4_typemap.html) spec to existing files in a depot.

## P4 Retrieve

Python script used to download a change list from a perforce server even if you have read only access.
Was in a situation where I needed to download a shelved changelist but my perms only meant I had read-only access (so I couldn't unshelve the files), and this was my solution.

------

Will add more as I need them.
